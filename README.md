# All about that pose
Check if u do ur pose correctly

## Setup
- yarn
- yarn watch

## Inspiration
Enabling people to master complex movements without a professional trainer, for example Pushups.
We also want to enable blind people to master those same movements without human help. The computer will give the user audible cues to correct their poses.

## What it does
In the first stage it records movements, for example a series of pushups.
Those observations are then analyzed and the user gets improvement advice.

## How we built it
We used complex, state-of-the-art, deep learning algorithms for computer vision.

## Challenges we ran into
Highly complex mathematical problems.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of


## What we learned
Nothing, we were born perfect.

## What's next for AllAboutThatPose
World domination

## Built With
