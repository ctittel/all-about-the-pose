This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
- npm install
- npm run start

## Inspiration
AllAboutThatPose wants to enable people to master complex movements without the help of a professional trainer.
We want to give people improvement advice that is as good or even better than a human could offer.

Our special focus is on helping men and women with disabilities, for example blind people.

## What it does
AllAboutThatPose records movements (for example Push-Ups) as a sequence of poses. 
The observed poses are then analyzed with modern computer vision and deep learning technology to give the user valuable feedback for improvement.

Blind users can interact with the app through text-to-speech and speech recognition technology and do thus not depend on external help.

The goal is to help people master the movement as quickly as possible by giving them the best possible advice.

## How we built it
We used complex, state-of-the-art, deep learning algorithms for computer vision.

## Challenges we ran into
The challenge was not only in applying the state-of-the-art technology on new problems but also at the intersection of the different technologies we used.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
That we managed to combine many different complex technologies into a working product.

## What we learned
Valuable insight in state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

## What's next for AllAboutThatPose
Expand AllAboutThatPose to be able to analyze movements from all areas of life, for example:
- Sports: Deadlifts, long-jump, etc.
- Dances
- In the workplace, to teach employees new manual tasks

## Built With
With web technologies, deep learning and computer vision techniques.
