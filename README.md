This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
- npm install
- npm run start

## Inspiration
Enabling people to master complex movements without a professional trainer, for example Pushups.
We also want to enable blind people to master those same movements without human help. The computer will give the user audible cues to correct their poses.

## What it does
AllAboutThatPose observes movements (for example Push-Ups) as a sequence of poses. 
The poses are then analyzed with modern computer vision and deep learning technology to give the user valuable feedback for improvement.

Blind users can interact with the app through text-to-speech and speech recognition technology.

So our application can replace a human trainer for the movements it knows and can even give better improvement advice.

## How we built it
We used complex, state-of-the-art, deep learning algorithms for computer vision.

## Challenges we ran into
Highly complex mathematical problems.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
That we managed to combine many different complex technologies into a working product.

## What we learned
Valuable insight in state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

## What's next for AllAboutThatPose
Expand AllAboutThatPose to be able to analyze movements from all areas of life, for example:
- Sports: Deadlifts, long-jump, etc.
- Dances
- In the workplace, to teach employees new manual tasks

## Built With
With web technologies, deep learning and computer vision techniques.
